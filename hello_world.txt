I may use this space for some quick notes while working thru the Git Basics section of the fundamentals course.

Use ATOMIC COMMITS to make commit messages more useful to future collaborators
 - A commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program.

 - Why use atomic commits?
    > If something goes wrong, its easy to revert from the specific change without losing many other changes.
    
    > Pushes you to write better commit messages.

I have added Git to my Surface Pro 9 as well as my desktop VM as of 6:36PM on December 12, 2023.
