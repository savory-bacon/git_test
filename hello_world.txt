I may use this space for some quick notes while working thru the Git Basics section of the fundamentals course.

Use ATOMIC COMMITS to make commit messages more useful to future collaborators
 - A commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program.

    > If something goes wrong, its easy to revert from the specific change without losing many other changes.
    
    > Pushes you to write better commit messages.
